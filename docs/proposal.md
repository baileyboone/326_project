# Innovative Idea

Please describe your team's innovative idea for your project.

Catch is a pet-based social media platform where people can publically announce a location and a window of time where other users can play with this pet. It's similar to other common social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, except that it has a real-time aspect.

On Facebook, content can be viewed at any time, whereas Catch is similar to the story feature that Snapchat has implemented, pets can only be enjoyed for as long as the owner wishes. An additional difference from existing products is the grouping of users. Users can be a pet lover, pet owner, or both.
