# Innovative Idea

Catch is a pet-based social media platform where people can publically announce a location and a window of time where other users can play with this pet. It's similar to other common social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, except that it has a real-time aspect.

On Facebook, content can be viewed at any time, whereas Catch is similar to the story feature that Snapchat has implemented, pets can only be enjoyed for as long as the owner wishes. An additional difference from existing products is the grouping of users. Users can be a pet lover, pet owner, or both. 


# Important Data

Location: One of our major UI components will be a real time map of the user and the events happening around them. This is so that they can conveniently find events. We will have continuously updating data on location of the user and events near them.
Event: Pet owners can create events to notify nearby pet lovers. The data involved will be: location, time, date, and description.
Pets: Pet owners can create profiles for each of their pets, this data will include images, species, age, and a description of their personality.
Activity: Users will generate data based on the events they attended. This will appear on their profile for other users to view. This data will include but is not limited to: how long they spent at each event, comments they had for the event, the pets they brought to the event. 
Images: Users can post images of their own pets or pets that they have met at events.
